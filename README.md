# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-with-CNN
This repository Contains the Python Source Code, Documentation and Support files for the Facial Emotion Recognition CNN.

The Dataset directory is supposed to contain the CK+ Dataset. To use a different dataset, the ckPlusInterface.py module found in the Code directory may need to be modified.

The Emotion Dataset directory is the location where the code is configured to store processed data from the CK+ Dataset.

The project can be run through the masterControl.py module.

All path variable are specified within the different modules. Therefor to use different paths, the path variables in each module must be modified.

The Support directory contains a pre-trained CNN and the file required for the LBP Cascade Classifier.
